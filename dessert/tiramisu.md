## Swedish replacement ingridients
|Original         | Replacement                    | Comments   |
| --------------- |--------------------------------| ---------- |
|Red wine         | Brachetto d´Acqui Braida, 2022 | Bärigt, pärlande, sött vin med inslag av körsbär, jordgubbar, rosor och hallon. |
|Liquour          | Sprezzo Coffee Liqueur         | Mycket söt, rostad smak med tydlig karaktär av kaffe, inslag av torkad frukt och choklad |
| Vanilla extract | Vaniljsocker                   | Some recommend twice as much vaniljsocker as vanilla extract. I used the same amount |
| Espresso        | Aero press                     | James Hoffmans 200g water to ~11-12g coffee. Coffee taste did not come forward as much |


## Improvements
Best results so far by modifying the egg mixture.

Seperate egg white and egg yolks into seperate bowls.
<ol>
  <li><i>Mix</i> <b>sugar</b>, <b>salt</b> and <b>egg yolks</b>. <i>Whip the mixture until goey.</i></li>
  <li><i>Whip</i> <b>sugar</b> until its like a soft cone serve.</strong></li>
  <li>On slow speed, gently mix mascarpone with the eggyolk mixture</li>
  <li>Using a silicon spatula, gently fold egg whites into the eggyolk mixture. Carefull to ruin the fluff as little as possible.</li>
</ol>



## To be experimented with
Pastorize eggyolk mixture and egg whites seperateley, instead of everything together. Pastorize to 71*c. 


## Tiramisoup
Happened two times when following the original recipe. Root cause is unclear, potential errors could be
- Use of a immersion blender with baloon whisk attatchment not sufficient to create the proper fluffiness.
- Overcooked or undercooked pastorized egg mixture


## Takeaways
- If one have to whip it with an imersion blender with baloon whish attatchment, whip eggyolk and whites seperately.
- Still good with aeropress coffee, but use espresso if you want the coffee flavour to be more present.
